  <h1>Kernel Density Estimation</h1>
  <p>
    For my project, I’m using ranger GPS data to identify existing footpaths and estimate movement speeds. The goal is to train a model that can predict how fast rangers are likely to move through different terrain, to support better planning when tracking and intercepting poachers. 
    
    My main focus of the first couple weeks has been on developing a method to estimate the likelihood that a footpath exists at any given location. To do this, I’m using kernel density ranking based on GPS point data.

    Figure 1: A 2D Gaussian distribution is centered at each data point, where the intensity is highest at the point itself and decreases with distance. 

    Figure 2: Where these Gaussians overlap, their intensities are summed, resulting in a heatmap storing the cumulative density of nearby points. This connects some points on the path

  </p>

  <h5>Implementation Practicalities</h5>
  <p>
    The values for each pixel of the Gaussian are computed once and then “stamped” over each GPS point. 
    They do not need to be recomputed every time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Further consideration into the standard deviation of the Gaussian is needed. The current value is arbitrary, 
    based on what looked visually reasonable with real data. Research is needed to determine how it should relate to the real data.
  </p>

  <h2>Kernel Density Ranking</h2>
  <p>
    The raw intensity values are skewed by time spent at base camp. 
    Figure 3 shows the raw values; base camp dominates due to its exponential intensity.
    Ranking the values instead results in Figure 4.
    Raw intensity values – base camp dominates.

  <h2>Adding Speed</h2>
  <p>
    Data is stored as sequential <code>[x, y, time]</code> entries. Distance between consecutive points is calculated 
    using the Haversine formula. Speed is derived from the distance and time difference.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each point is assigned the speed required to reach it from the previous one. 
    We then compute a weighted average speed for each pixel using Gaussian intensity weights.

  <h3>Speed vs Path</h3>
  <p>Do we see a relationship between speed and path intensity or rank?</p>

    <div class="figure-caption">Speed vs Path Intensity</div>
  </div>

  <p>No, no we can’t.</p>

  <h2>Calculating Directional Speed</h2>
  <p>
    To investigate slope effects, we measure speed in four directions (N, S, E, W). 
    This is done by computing vector components between GPS points.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example:
    <ul>
      <li>1-2: √2 units North and √2 units East</li>
      <li>2-3: 1 unit East</li>
      <li>3-4: Some units East and South</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    These are stored in four separate directional speed maps.
  </p>

  <h3>North vs South / East vs West</h3>
  <p>
    We checked if it’s significantly faster in certain directions due to terrain (e.g., steep hills).
    No major differences observed.
